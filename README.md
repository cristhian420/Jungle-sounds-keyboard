### JS
In this proyect i use commands like addEventListener to know when keys was down and know what key was too. 
With this information we know what container is (div) and transform with visual changes adding a class and play animal's sound.
I also used addEventListener to know when the appearance had been changed and to make it return to its original appearance.

### HTML
Use audio tag and with javascript use methods to play and pause.

### CSS
Make the First letter bigger that rest of word to indicate which key need press
